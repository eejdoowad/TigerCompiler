# Tiger Compiler

A compiler for a C-like language, written in Java by a team of three for CS 4240.

Built from scratch from the ground up

Components include:

* Table-driven scanner

* LL(1) top-down parser

* Semantic Analyzer

* IR code Generator

* Register Allocation Code for:

  * Naive register allocation

  * Intra-BasicBlock register allocation

  * Global register allocation

* MIPs code generator (output runs on SPIM simulator)

There are many things we would do differently in retrospect... but won't. Because it works. And because, as one partner put it, "I've never spent so much time on something so useless." 

The take away is knoweldge and experience. Applying theory to practice.
